# Regular Expression To Automata

A small program that demonstrates finite automata construction from a regular
expression passed as a command line argument. The output is dot (graphviz)
source.

The regular expression grammar recognizes (so far) alternations, Kleene
closures, and parenthesized expressions. The alphabet is limited to Î£={a,b}.
